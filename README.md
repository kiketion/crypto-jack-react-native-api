# Jack Crypto React Native API

Inspired in my dog, a Jack Russell Terrier named Jack, I decided to create a React Native API Jack Crypto, to help people to watch the crypto market easily.

In this project i have used the CoinGecko API to get the data of the crypto currencies, and the React Native Library to create the UI.
